		<p align="center">
		Hello, World! My name is Gabrielle Johnston and I’m am currently a 
		freshman at Iowa State University.  I am perusing my Bachelor’s 
		degree in Software Engineering.  I am currently looking for a 
		summer internship for the summer of 2018 in the field of software 
		development.
		<!-- </p> -->
		<!-- <p> -->
		I am interested in a work environment that works together in teams as
		well as one that is constantly learning.  I am looking to grow as 
		a programmer and use the skills that I have recently developed in 
		the classroom.

		<h4><em><u>Work Experience</u></em></h4>
		<p>
		This summer and fall I will be on co-op working for Rockwell Collins
		in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  I am looking forward to learning all that I 
		can! 
		<br>
		<br>
		In the summer between 2013-2016 I have worked as a lifeguard at 
		the West Union Aquatic Center in West Union, Iowa.  There I learned
		valuable skills working with my team along with increasing my work 
		ethic, talking with people, and executing rescues.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the spring of 2015, I completed a one day job shadow at Rockwell 
		Collins with a software and a systems engineer.  Though I hadn’t 
		started my programing career, I still found the experience valuable.
		I learned more about what software engineers were, along with how 
		all kinds of engineers worked together on a team.  The different
		path people take before entering the workforce can bring diversity
		and can lead to more creative problem-solving.

		<h4><em><u>Academics</u></em></h4>
		<p>
		I am currently finishing up my first year at Iowa State University. 
		Though I did not have much programming experience before coming here,
		I have learned many new skills.  I believe that my problem solving 
		skills in particular have been amplified over the past year, both 
		from my programming classes  and the different calculus classes that 
		are required. 
		<br>
		<br>
		From the past accedemic semester, I was named to the College of 
		Engineering Dean’s List for the Fall 2016.  This spring, I was also 
		named aspart of the top 2% of the College of Engineering sophomores.
