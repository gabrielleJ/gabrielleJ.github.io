		Hello, World! My name is Gabrielle Johnston and I’m am currently a 
		freshman at Iowa State University.  I am perusing my Bachelor’s 
		degree in Software Engineering.  I am currently looking for a 
		summer internship for the summer of 2018 in the field of software 
		development. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I am interested in a work environment that works together in teams as
		well as one that is constantly learning.  I am looking to grow as 
		a programmer and use the skills that I have recently developed in 
		the classroom.   
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		<h4><em>Languages I've learned:</em></h4>
		<ul>
			<li>C - Introduction to software engineering (SE 185)</li>
			<li>Java - Introduction to Object-oriented Progarming (Com S 227)</li>
			<li>HTML/CSS - On my own</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h4><em>Work Experience</em></h4>
		<p>
		This summer and fall I will be on co-op working for Rockwell Collins
		in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  I am looking forward to learning all that I 
		can! 
		<br>
		<br>
		In the summer between 2013-2016 I have worked as a lifeguard at 
		the West Union Aqualic Center in West Union, Iowa.  There I learned
		valuable skills working with my team along with increasing my work 
		ethic, talking with people, and executing rescues.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the spring of 2015, I completed a one day job shadow at Rockwell 
		Collins with a software and a systems engineer.  Though I hadn’t 
		started my programing career, I still found the experience valuable.
		I learned more about what software engineers were, along with how 
		all kinds of engineers worked together on a team.  The different
		path people take before entering the workforce can bring diversity
		and can lead to more creative problem-solving.
